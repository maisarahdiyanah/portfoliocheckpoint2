        <h3> Fudgy Brownies</h3>        
        <img src='images/brownies.jpeg' alt="Picture of brownies"/>
        <p>Whenever I need to fulfill my chocolate cravings, brownies are always my go-to treat as it takes less than an hour to make. I personally prefer fudgy brownies that are gooey and rich on the inside. This is a recipe I took from <a href = 'https://tasty.co/recipe/the-best-fudgy-brownies'>Tasty</a> which I have used for over four years now!</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>8 oz good quality chocolate, semi-sweet</li>
                <li>12 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups sugar </li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>¼ cup cocoa powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h4>Preparation</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line an 8-inch (20 cm) square baking dish with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Chop the chocolate into chunks. Melt half of the chocolate in the microwave in 20-second intervals, saving the other half for later.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, mix the butter and sugar with an electric hand mixer, then beat in the eggs and vanilla for 1-2 minutes, until the mixture becomes fluffy and light in color.</li>
                <li>Whisk in the melted chocolate (make sure it's not too hot or else the eggs will cook), then sift in the flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Fold to incorporate the dry ingredients, being careful not to overmix as this will cause the brownies to be more cake-like in texture.</li>
                <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then transfer the batter to the prepared baking dish.</li>
                <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, depending on how fudgy you like your brownies, then cool completely.</li>
            </ol>

        <img src='images/kuihmakmur.jpeg' alt="Picture of snow cookie"/>
        
        <p>Kuih Makmur, also known as "Kuih Momo" or "Snowball Cookies", is a traditional Malay dessert that is usually prepared during the Eid Al-Fitr festival. Growing up, this was one of my favorite cookies as a Malaysian celebrating Eid. What I like about kuih makmur is that it has peanuts in it, and is not too sweet at all. This dessert is popular in Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei.  </p>

        <h3> White Chocolate Chip Matcha Cookies</h3>
        <img src='images/matchacookie.jpg' alt="Picture of matcha cookie"/>
        <p>Fun fact about me, I'm a matcha freak! I love all things matcha, from matcha desserts to matcha beauty products, you name it! These cookies are incredibly delicious and will definitely satisfy the cravings of all you matcha lovers! </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>½ tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp matcha powder</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 eggs room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup white chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Brown your butter. Heat your butter over medium heat until it turns a golden yellow color. Pour butter in a heat proof bowl to cool. As the butter cools, it will get darker in color.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, baking soda, salt, and matcha powder in a medium size mixing bowl. Mix well and set aside.</li>
            <li>Next add in white sugar and brown sugar to your butter. Mix to combine. Once well combined, add in your eggs and vanilla. Whisk together. Whisk until you get a light and creamy texture (~1 minute). This is the key to getting a crisp and chewy cookie.</li>
            <li>Once the wet ingredients are well mixed, slowly add in the dry ingredients from step 3. Combine with a spatula until a green dough forms.</li>
            <li>Add in the white chocolate chips and mix until they are well incorporated.</li>
            <li>Let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cover 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Use a 3 tablespoon (1.5 oz) ice cream scoop to scoop cookie dough onto baking sheets. Cookies should be 2-3 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Bake for 9-11 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let cookies cool for 10 minutes before putting them on a cooling rack.</li>
            <li>Cool cookies for another 15 minutes before serving.</li>

        <h3> Honey Cornflake Cookies</h3>
        <img src='images/honeycorn.png' alt="Picture of honey cornflake cookies"/>
        <p>These are actually the easiest cookies in the world to make, yet they're so good and are all Malaysians' favorite, especially during the Raya celebration (Eid-Al-Fitr). I remember going to open houses during the festive season and this would be the first thing I look for. Trust me when I tell you that this cookie is the real deal if you love honey and cornflakes!</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>5 cups cornflakes</li>
            <li>¼ cup honey</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoon caster sugar</li>
            <li>Sprinkles (optional)</li>
            <li>Paper cups</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a pan with low heat, then put the honey and sugar in and mix.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, crunch the cornflakes so that it is easy to put it in the paper cups.</li>
            <li>Pour the butter mixture into the bowl with the cornflakes, mix until the cornflakes are fully coated.</li>
            <li>Scoop the cornflakes into the paper cups using two spoons.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes, with a temperature of 150c. </li>

        <h3> Onde-onde</h3>
        <img src='images/ondeonde.png' alt="Picture of onde-onde"/>
        <p>Here's another Malaysian kuih (term for Malaysian sweet cakes or pastries) that's super yummy and easy to make. This is called onde-onde, a dessert that's infused with pandan (screwpine leaf) juice and filled with "gula melaka" or palm sugar. The best part of this kuih is when the palm sugar from the middle bursts in your mouth when you take a bite! Onde-onde is very popular in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. It is also called "buah melaka" in Malaysia and "klepon" in Indonesia.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>250 g (8 oz.) glutinous rice flour</li>
            <li>200 ml Pandan juice</li>
            <li>100 g (3.5 oz.) grated coconut</li>
            <li>1 pinch sea salt</li>
            <li>150 g (5 oz.) Gula Melaka or palm sugar, finely chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the glutinous rice flour with Pandan juice and knead lightly. Pinch a small piece of the dough (about 40 g/2 oz.) and drop it into boiling water.</li>
            <li>When the dough rises up the surface, remove it with a slotted spoon and shake off the excess water. Mix it back into the main dough and knead well to form a smooth dough. Cover the dough and set aside for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix the grated coconut with a pinch of salt and steam for about 2 - 3 minutes and let it cool completely.</li>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to boil. Pinch a small piece of dough (about 15 g each) and flatten lightly. Fill the center of the dough with Gula Melaka or palm sugar. Roll it in your palms to form a smooth ball. Repeat the same until all ingredients are used up.</li>
            <li>Cook the onde-onde balls in boiling water. When they float to the surface, remove them with a slotted spoon and shake off the excess water. Coat the onde-onde with grated coconut and serve immediately.</li>

        <h3>Homemade Scones</h3>
        <img src='images/scones.png' alt="Picture of scones"/>
        <img src='images/sconeskoko.png' alt="Second pic of scones"/>
        <p>When someone says the word "scone", I do not think of the sugar-dusted pastries in the Starbucks display, I think about the authentic British scone that's served with a cup of warm tea in a British tea-time spread. British scones are usually eaten with jam and clotted cream. My grandmother used to make these every week for the family, and I would have about two a day (one for breakfast and one for tea-time) cause it was just that good. When I was living in the UK during my childhood years, scones were my favorite dessert and they were so easily accessible since they originated from there. In Malaysia and in the US, it's rather hard to find good quality British scones, which is why I'm grateful for my grandmother and for this recipe. Hope you enjoy!</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>4 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>½ tsp salt</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp unsalted butter , cold</li>
            <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk beaten with 1 Tbsp milk (to glaze)</li>
            <li>Strawberry jam (to serve)</li>
            <li>Clotted cream, at room temperature (to serve)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 425F.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, place the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and butter. Rub the mixture together with your fingers to break up the butter, until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Add the milk slowly, mixing as you add, using enough of the milk to get your dough to come together with no lumps remaining. (Your dough should be quite sticky. If a good consistency is not achieved with the listed amount of milk, continue adding until your dough reaches a good consistency.)</li>
            <li>Spoon the dough out until a well-floured surface. Generously dust the top of the dough and knead the dough 2-3 times to coat it with flour and smooth the surface. Press the dough into a round that is roughly 1 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Using a well-floured cookie cutter, cut the dough into 2 inch circles. (Be sure to press the cookie cutter straight down and up. Twisting the cookie cutter will impact the amount of rise you get on your scones.) </li>
            <li>Place the rounds onto a greased and floured baking sheet. Brush them gently with the egg yolk and milk mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake the scones for 12-15 minutes, until golden and firm.</li>
            <li>Remove the baked scones from the oven and let them cool for 30 minutes (if you can resist). If you like softer scones, cover them with a clean tea towel as they cool.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3> Lotus Biscoff Cheesecake</h3>
        <img src='images/lotus.png' alt="Picture of lotus cheesecake"/>
        <p>This no-bake lotus Biscoff cheesecake is the perfect cheesecake recipe for all the Biscoff lovers. This recipe went viral in Malaysia back in 2020 during lockdown, and I remember seeing everyone posting their attempts at making this cheesecake on social media. Crazily enough, the lotus Biscoff spread actually ran out of stock in the whole city of Kuala Lumpur since everyone was raving about it at the time! I made this when the storm calmed down a little and I finally got my hands on the spread. To be honest, my mother was the one who kept pestering me to make this cake for her, and when I finally did, I'm glad she liked it! </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <h5>For the crust:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>250g (9oz) Lotus Biscoff cookies</li>
            <li>6 tbsp (90g) Butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>For the filling:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>2½ cups (565g) Cream cheese</li>
            <li>200g (7oz) Lotus Biscoff spread</li>
            <li>1 cup (240ml) Heavy cream, cold</li>
            <li>2/3 cup (85g) Powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
            <li>14g Gelatin powder +70ml water</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>For the topping:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>200g (7oz) Lotus Biscoff spread </li>
            <li>3-4 Crushed cookies</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the crust: In a food processor or a ziploc bag crush the lotus biscuits into fine crumbs. Add melted butter and pulse until combined. Press into bottom of 9-inch (23cm) springform pan. Refrigerate while making the filling.</li>
            <li>Make the filling: In a small bowl stir gelatin powder and water. Let bloom for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl beat cream cheese, vanilla extract and cookie butter until soft and smooth. In a separate bowl beat heavy cream with powdered sugar until medium-stiff peaks form. Gradually fold whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Melt the gelatin in the microwave for 15 seconds. Temper the gelatin: Gradually add few tablespoons of the cheesecake mixture into the dissolved gelatin and stir until combined. Pour back to the cheesecake mixture and mix until combined.</li>
            <li>Pour into the springform pan and freeze for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile prepare the topping: place biscoff cookie butter in a heatproof bowl and melt in the microwave until melted. While still liquid pour over the cheesecake.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate the cake for at least 6 hours, until set.</li>
            <li>Decoration: release the cake from the pan and garnish the cake with crushed cookies around the edges.</li>
