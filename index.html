            <p>For my 22nd birthday, my boyfriend took me to a fancy seafood restaurant in Detroit named Joe Muer Seafood. The overall experience was immaculate! The food and drinks were good, there was live classical music at the restaurant, and the view was Canada. Literally. 
            For our appetizers, we ordered the lobster corn dog and a Boston clam chowder. The lobster corn dog was served with napa cabbage slaw and pommery hollandaise sauce. Let me just start by saying that it was one of the best appetizers I've ever had in my life! The lobster was perfectly cooked and the batter was crispy and delicious.
        For our main course meals, we ordered the shrimp and scallop linguine and the crab-stuffed atlantic flounder. Both dishes were SO good. I remember how buttery the flounder tasted as it was served with creamed spinach. And the pasta.. so good. It was also a little spicy, which definitely satisfied my Asian tastebuds.
        And of course, what's a birthday dinner without dessert? For dessert, we had the creme brulee and a piece of key lime pie.</p>

            <p> Coming from Kuala Lumpur which has many amazing brunch places, it was hard for me to accept the fact that Michigan didn't really have a good brunch cafe that impressed me with their food. That perception changed when I went to Commonwealth Cafe in Birmingham, Michigan. 
                I was surprised at how good the food was here, and came back another time to try out different menu items! </p>

            <p>When it comes to Korean food in Michigan, Kimchi Box is definitely my go-to! My favorite items from the menu are the Korean sassy wings, potato dogs, fish tacos, kimchi fries, and duk-bok-ki! 
                I recently tried their new menu item which is the street toast with bulgogi, and that was pretty yummy too! I definitely recommend this place to those of you searching for some Korean comfort food. They also have 
            branches in Sterling Heights, Novi and Auburn Hills. Visit their website here https://kimchiboxusa.com/. </p>
