        <p>My full name is actually Maisarah Diyanah Mahathir. Pretty long in its nature so I just go by Mai. I am from Malaysia, but am currently residing in the US as I am a senior at the University of Michigan studying Psychology and User Experience. My hobbies include cooking/baking, reading, running, boxing and recently gaming!
            I started this website because I wanted a place where I could not only document my recipes and food that I enjoy, but also a place to run my small business, Mai Bakes! I first started Mai Bakes during the pandemic last year.
           I have always had a passion for baking, and quarantining during the pandemic gave me the time to explore my capabilities and strengths as a baker. I started making new things, experimenting new recipes and exploring different kinds of baked goods that I could potentially make. After a while, all I wanted to do was share what I was making with the community, in hopes of bringing light and joy amidst those dark times through my baked goods.
